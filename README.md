## About the app
The app is just a showcase for an upcoming tutorial on React. The tutorial will be posted on my website and I'll attach the link when it's out.

The Student Picker app allows teachers to enter the names of their students and pick one of them randomly -> for example to decide who will be next for testing.

You are free to download the app, use it and modify it.
